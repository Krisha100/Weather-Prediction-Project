# Weather-Prediction-Project

The main problem I worked on was to predict whether it is going to rain or snow on a particular day based on the weather data set. First, I cleaned the data set and did preliminary analysis to gather all the relevant information.

Further, I divided columns into Categorical and Numerical Features. Then performed Univariate and Bivariate analysis on certain variables to determine how they are related to each other. Moving on to plotting the Correlation matrix to keep only the relevant features for the final analysis.

Then, I performed certain steps for usage of data in Logistic Regression algorithm. Finally, I built a Predictive model and determined and double-checked accuracy of the model.
